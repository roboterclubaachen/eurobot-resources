	<!-- Our internal coordinate system is:

		- the origin is in the center of the game area
		- x axis: goes from the stairs to the building area from negative to positive (left to right)
		- y axis: goes from the yellow to green start area from negative to positive (down to up)

		Please note that the y-axis polarity is the opposite of the typical graphics drawing coordinate system.
		Since we want the x and y positions of the elements to the in our internal coordinate system,
		we need to flip the y-axis around the x-axis.

		In order to see the entire SVG in a we browser we must also translate the entire SVG into positive coordinates.
		This is since most webbrowsers clip the SVG viewbox apparently at origin (0,0) and therefore a negative viewbox
		origin is not displayed. We also scale and rotate there for easier viewing.
